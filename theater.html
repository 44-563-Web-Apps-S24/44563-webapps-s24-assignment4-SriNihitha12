    <h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act 4 by Anton Chekhov</h2>
<p>YASHA. To those departing! And good luck to those who stay behind!</p>
<p>[Drinks] I can assure you that this isn't real champagne.</p>

<p>LOPAKHIN. Eight roubles a bottle. [Pause] It's devilish cold here.</p>

<p>YASHA. There are no fires to-day, we're going away. [Laughs]</p>

<p>LOPAKHIN. What's the matter with you?</p>

<p>YASHA. I'm just pleased.</p>
<p>LOPAKHIN. It's October outside, but it's as sunny and as quiet as if
    it were summer. Good for building. [Looking at his watch and speaking
    through the door] Ladies and gentlemen, please remember that it's only
    forty-seven minutes till the train goes! You must go off to the station
    in twenty minutes. Hurry up.</p>
<p>[TROFIMOV, in an overcoat, comes in from the grounds.]</p>
<p>TROFIMOV. I think it's time we went. The carriages are waiting. Where
    the devil are my goloshes? They're lost. [Through the door] Anya, I
    can't find my goloshes! I can't!</p>

<p>LOPAKHIN. I've got to go to Kharkov. I'm going in the same train as you.
    I'm going to spend the whole winter in Kharkov. I've been hanging about
    with you people, going rusty without work. I can't live without working.
    I must have something to do with my hands; they hang about as if they
    weren't mine at all.</p>

<p>TROFIMOV. We'll go away now and then you'll start again on your useful
    labours.</p>

<p>LOPAKHIN. Have a glass.</p>
<p>TROFIMOV. I won't.</p>
<p>LOPAKHIN. So you're off to Moscow now?</p>
<p>TROFIMOV Yes. I'll see them into town and to-morrow I'm off to Moscow.</p>
<p>LOPAKHIN. Yes.... I expect the professors don't lecture nowadays;
    they're waiting till you turn up!</p>

<p>TROFIMOV. That's not your business.</p>
